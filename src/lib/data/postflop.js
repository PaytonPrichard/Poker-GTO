export const principles = [
  {
    title: 'Position is everything',
    body:  'IP player sees villain\'s action before deciding. This allows IP to realize more equity on every street — hence why IP calls more hands preflop and bets wider postflop.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Range advantage vs nut advantage',
    body:  'Range advantage = your overall range has higher equity on this board. Nut advantage = you have more of the strongest hands (nutted hands). Both matter. Range advantage drives frequency; nut advantage drives sizing.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Bet sizing is a signal',
    body:  'Small bets (25–33%) work best when betting polarization is low (all hands benefit). Large bets (66–100%+) work when your range is polarized. Calibrate by how much of your range wants to bet at that size.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Equity realization',
    body:  'Not all hands realize their raw equity. Position, playability, and opponent ranges affect this. Suited connectors and pairs realize more equity IP than OOP. Account for this when evaluating thin preflop calls.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Balancing check-raises',
    body:  'When you check, villain may bet. Having check-raises in your range (both value and bluffs) prevents exploitation. Without check-raises, villain can bet freely knowing you\'ll only call or fold.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Blockers on the river',
    body:  'Holding a card reduces the number of combos your opponent can have containing that rank. On a flush-completing river, holding a flush card is a good bluff — you block villain\'s strong flush hands that might call your bluff.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Mixed frequencies vs pure strategies',
    body:  'GTO solvers often split borderline hands into mixed actions — e.g. "c-bet this hand 60%, check 40%." Core value hands and clear folds are pure (100% one action), but the middle of your range mixes. In practice, pick one action for each hand and focus on getting the overall range frequency roughly right rather than randomizing individual hands.',
