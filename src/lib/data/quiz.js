    category: 'Preflop',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    scenario: 'You are on the Button in a 6-max cash game, everyone folds to you.',
    question: 'What is the correct GTO open-raise sizing from the Button?',
    options: ['2x BB', '2.5x BB', '3x BB', '4x BB'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'In 6-max, the Button opens to 2.5x BB. Early position (UTG) uses 3x; late position (CO, BTN) uses 2.5x to account for better position and wider range.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    category: 'Preflop',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'UTG opens in a 6-max game. You are on the Button with J♠T♠.',
    question: 'What is the correct GTO action with JTs on the Button facing a UTG open?',
    options: [
      'Fold — JTs lacks the equity to continue vs a tight UTG opening range',
      '3-Bet only — use it as a bluff to take down the pot preflop',
      'Call only — flat in position to realize equity postflop with a playable hand',
      '3-Bet or call (mixed) — GTO mixes both actions to keep your range balanced',
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: 'JTs is a strong hand with great playability. In GTO, BTN uses JTs as a mix of 3-bet and call vs UTG — 3-betting adds value/fold equity; calling keeps range balanced with speculative hands.',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    category: 'Preflop',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'You open from the Cutoff, the Button 3-bets. You hold A♦K♦.',
    question: 'What is the correct action with AKs when facing a Button 3-bet?',
    options: [
      'Fold — the 3-bet indicates strength and AKs is dominated by QQ+',
      'Call the 3-bet — keep the pot small and realize equity in position',
      '4-bet for value — AKs is strong enough to build the pot preflop',
      '4-bet or call (mixed) — solver mixes both at meaningful frequencies',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'AKs is a premium value 4-bet. It is too strong to fold and often too strong to flat call — 4-betting extracts value and denies equity. GTO recommends 4-betting AKs at high frequency vs BTN 3-bet.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    category: 'Preflop',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    scenario: 'You are in the Small Blind in a 6-max game, all players fold to you.',
    question: 'The SB RFI range is roughly what percentage of hands vs the BB?',
    options: ['15–20%', '25–30%', '35–40%', '50–55%'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'The SB opens wide (~38%) vs the BB because it is heads-up and the BB already has 1 BB invested. The SB range is the widest RFI range in the game.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    category: 'Preflop',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    scenario: 'UTG opens, CO calls, you are on the BTN with 9♣8♣.',
    question: 'What is the correct GTO action with 98s in a squeeze spot (2 opponents in the pot)?',
    options: [
      'Fold — 98s lacks the equity to profitably enter vs two opponents',
      'Call (cold call) — implied odds justify peeling with a suited connector',
      'Squeeze 3-bet — fold equity plus playability make this a strong squeeze',
      'Depends entirely on stack depth — the action changes based on SPR',
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: '98s loses value vs two opponents in a multiway pot. Cold-calling is generally -EV here (dead money + OOP vs CO). Squeezing needs more equity to barrel. GTO predominantly folds 98s in this multi-opponent squeeze spot.',
  },

    category: 'Preflop',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'You have been 3-bet from the BB after opening UTG in a 6-max game. You hold Q♣Q♦.',
    question: 'What is the correct GTO action with QQ vs a BB 3-bet when you opened UTG?',
    options: [
      'Always fold — facing a 3-bet from the BB means you are likely dominated',
      'Always call — keep the pot manageable and see a flop in position',
      'Always 4-bet — QQ is too strong to ever flat and must build the pot',
      '4-bet at high frequency, rarely call — mix in some flats to stay balanced',
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: 'QQ vs a BB 3-bet is a clear 4-bet at high frequency. The BB 3-bet range is wide (bluff-heavy), so QQ has strong equity. Occasionally calling keeps range balanced. Folding is always wrong here.',
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    category: 'Preflop',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    scenario: 'You are in the Big Blind, the BTN opens to 2.5x, SB folds.',
    question: 'The BB defense range in 6-max vs a BTN open is approximately what width?',
    options: ['20–25% of hands', '30–35% of hands', '40–45% of hands', '50–55% of hands'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'The BB defends ~40–45% vs the BTN open — the widest defense range in the game. The BB already has 1 BB invested, gets a great price (call 1.5 more into ~4 pot), and BTN has the widest opening range.',

    category: 'Preflop',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    scenario: 'You open UTG in a 7-handed game (UTG+1 position exists). Stack depth is 40 BB.',
    question: 'How should stack depth at 40 BB affect your preflop sizing?',
    options: [
      'Use larger sizes since deeper stacks allow you to build bigger pots preflop',
      'Use standard sizes regardless of depth because GTO ranges stay the same',
      'Reduce open size to 2x since shallow stacks change pot commitment math',
      'Shove all-in preflop with premium hands to avoid difficult postflop spots',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'At 40 BB, pot commitment thresholds change. Opening smaller (2x) is correct — your SPR with standard 3x opens becomes very low, making fold equity with 3-bets/4-bets unreliable. Smaller opens preserve stack-to-pot flexibility.',

    scenario: 'You raised UTG, the BTN called. Flop is A♠-7♦-2♣ (dry, rainbow, ace-high).',
    question: 'What is the correct c-bet strategy on this dry ace-high flop as the PFR?',
    options: [
      'Check your entire range — avoid bloating the pot when villain could have Ax',
      'Bet large (75%+ pot) to protect your strong hands and charge draws heavily',
      'Bet small (25–33% pot) at high frequency — leverage your range advantage',
      'Bet medium (50% pot) selectively with top pair or better for value only',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'On dry ace-high boards the PFR has strong range advantage (lots of Ax in UTG range). GTO bets small and frequently — a small bet pressures all villain hands and doesn\'t require a polar distribution.',
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    category: 'Postflop',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'You c-bet 33% pot on a Q♥-J♥-9♦ flop and got called. The turn is the 2♣.',
    question: 'Which hand type should you barrel the turn with on this blank turn card?',
    options: [
      'Only top pair (QQ) and better — you need a strong hand to continue on wet boards',
      'Strong hands and flush draws / combo draws that retain equity if called again',
      'Only complete air (bluffs with no equity) — use pure bluffs to balance value bets',
      'All hands equally at the same frequency — remain perfectly balanced on every street',
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'On a wet board with a blank turn, continue barreling with strong made hands AND combo draws/flush draws that have equity. Pure air bluffs without equity (outs) are much less effective — you need a reason to continue.',
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    category: 'Postflop',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'You are OOP (BB) and checked the flop. Villain bets 50% pot. You hold middle pair.',
    question: 'What is the generally correct play with a medium-strength hand facing a c-bet OOP?',
    options: [
      'Always fold — middle pair has poor equity vs a bet and will face tough turns',
      'Always raise — show strength to take the pot before the board gets worse',
      'Check-call and reevaluate the turn — preserve showdown value without bloating',
      'Raise to 3x to define villain\'s range and price out draws on future streets',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'Medium-strength hands (middle pair) are classic check-call hands OOP. You have pot odds, showdown value, and don\'t want to bloat the pot. Check-raise turns this into a bluff-catcher or value hand depending on run-out.',
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    category: 'Postflop',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    scenario: 'BTN vs BB, you checked, villain bet 33% pot on K♦-8♣-3♥. You hold A♣-5♣.',
    question: 'With ace-high no pair on a dry board OOP, what is the GTO response to a small c-bet?',
    options: [
      'Fold — no made hand and no direct draws make this an easy release',
      'Call — backdoor equity plus ace-high showdown value justifies floating',
      'Check-raise as a bluff — fold out better hands and deny equity from draws',
      'Donk lead the turn if called — take an unusual line to win the pot OOP',
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'A♣5♣ has backdoor flush, backdoor straight potential, and ace-high has some showdown value vs underpairs/air. Floating a small c-bet on dry boards OOP is a viable GTO play — you can pick up the pot on favorable turns.',
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    category: 'Postflop',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    scenario: 'You are the PFR and it is the river. Board is K♥-Q♦-7♣-2♠-J♦.',
    question: 'On the river with a polarized range, what bet size is most appropriate?',
    options: [
      '25–33% pot — small sizing to get calls from medium-strength bluff catchers',
      '50% pot — balanced, moderate sizing that works with your entire range',
      '75–100% pot — large sizing to polarize between strong value and bluffs',
      'Check to protect your range and avoid putting more money in with air',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'The river is where polarization is maximized. With a polarized range (strong hands + bluffs), use large sizes (75–100%+ pot). This forces villain to face a difficult decision and maximizes EV from both your value hands and bluffs.',
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    category: 'Postflop',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    scenario: 'You bet 75% pot on the river as a bluff. Villain is facing your bet.',

    options: ['33% of the time', '43% of the time', '50% of the time', '57% of the time'],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: 'MDF = pot / (pot + bet). At 75% pot: pot = 1, bet = 0.75, MDF = 1 / 1.75 ≈ 57%. Villain must call at least 57% of the time to prevent you from profiting with any bluff. They can fold at most 43%.',
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    category: 'Postflop',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'You have the nut flush draw on the flop. Villain bets pot into you.',
    question: 'With a nut flush draw (9 outs) facing a pot-size bet, what is the correct action?',
    options: [
      'Fold — not enough equity to continue profitably against a pot-size bet',
      'Call — you have the right pot odds with ~36% equity over two streets',
      'Raise — your draw equity plus fold equity makes raising clearly best',
      'Call or raise depending on stack depth — both can be correct at different SPRs',
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: 'NFD has ~36% equity (two cards to come). Pot odds for a call vs pot-bet = 33% needed equity, so calling is profitable. But raising adds fold equity. The correct play (call vs raise) depends on SPR and stack depth. Both can be correct.',
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    category: 'Postflop',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'You c-bet on a monotone (all same suit) flop and villain called. Turn pairs the board.',
    question: 'On a paired turn after a monotone flop, what adjustment is correct?',
    options: [
      'Always fire again — board pairing favors the preflop aggressor\'s range',
      'Always check — the paired turn slows down action for both players\' ranges',
      'Check most hands; bet only strong made hands and top flush draws selectively',
      'Use an overbet to maximize fold equity against capped calling range on turn',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'After a monotone flop, a paired turn helps the caller\'s range (they have full houses now) and reduces villain\'s drawing hands. GTO slows down with most hands, barreling only with flush+FH draws or made hands strong enough to continue.',
  },

    question: 'What is the Stack-to-Pot Ratio (SPR) in this situation?',
    options: ['~6', '~9', '~16', '~94'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'SPR = effective stack ÷ pot. 94 BB ÷ 6 BB ≈ 15.7, roughly 16. High SPR means you should be very careful about committing — you need a very strong hand to stack off.',

    question: 'What is the minimum equity you need to call this bet profitably?',
    options: ['25%', '33%', '40%', '50%'],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: 'Equity needed = call / (total pot after call) = 50 / (100 + 50 + 50) = 50 / 200 = 25%. You need 25% equity to profitably call a 50% pot bet.',

    question: 'What is the Minimum Defense Frequency (MDF) you must maintain vs this pot-size bet?',
    options: ['33%', '50%', '67%', '75%'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'MDF = pot / (pot + bet) = 100 / (100 + 100) = 50%. You must defend (call or raise) at least 50% of your range vs a pot-size bet to prevent villain from profitably bluffing with any two cards.',

    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'SPR at the flop is 2. You hold top pair top kicker (TPTK).',
    question: 'With an SPR of 2, how should you approach commitment decisions?',
    options: [
      'Be cautious — low SPR means villain\'s range could have you dominated often',
      'Stack off immediately — low SPR makes folding mathematically negative EV',
      'TPTK is strong enough to stack off profitably at SPR below 4 in most spots',
      'Check and pot control — protect your hand against draws and suckouts on later streets',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'At SPR < 4, TPTK and better are generally strong enough to commit. Low SPR means you can\'t make enough "pot-sized mistakes" by folding — the math favors getting it in with strong one-pair hands.',

    category: 'Sizing',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    scenario: 'You are the PFR with an uncapped range. Villain\'s range is capped (no strong hands). River pot is $100.',
    question: 'When you have nut advantage and villain\'s range is capped, what sizing is most profitable?',
    options: [
      '33% pot — small sizing keeps villain calling with their weaker made hands',
      '66% pot — balanced medium sizing that works across value and bluff hands',
      '100% pot — full pot bet maximizes value while keeping bluffs profitable',
      'Overbet (150%+ pot) — exploit the nut advantage against a capped range',
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: 'Overbets are optimal when you have nut advantage and villain is range-capped. Villain cannot have the nuts so cannot raise you off your hand. Your strong hands extract maximum value; your bluffs are also more profitable because villain must call more to defend.',

    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'Multiway pots improve implied odds for speculative hands. More opponents means more chances for someone to have a strong hand willing to pay off when you hit your set, flush, or straight. This is why speculative hands (pairs, suited connectors) gain value multiway.',

      'The BB has position in SB vs BB pots and thus always has the advantage — acting last on every postflop street compounds the edge significantly',
      'The BB never has a range advantage against the raiser — the preflop aggressor always maintains an equity edge on every board texture',
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'The BB defends wide vs the SB (suited connectors, small pairs, Axs, etc.) and these hands connect well with low/medium flops. On boards like 8-6-3 or 7-5-2, the BB\'s range actually has more sets, two pairs, and strong pairs than the SB\'s wider raising range. This is why the BB donk-bets at higher frequencies vs the SB than in any other spot — range advantage on favorable board textures.',

    scenario: 'You raise preflop, get called. You c-bet the flop, get called. Turn and river check through. Villain shows a weak pair they called with.',
    question: 'What mistake does "one and done" c-betting (betting flop then giving up) represent?',
    options: [
      'This is always correct — checking the turn and river after a called c-bet is the standard play to pot-control with your entire range',
      'Failing to have a multi-street plan — betting the flop without a turn/river strategy leaves money on the table and wastes chips as bluffs',
      'You should never c-bet at all — avoiding the flop bet entirely eliminates this leak risk and keeps your range better protected when checking',
      'The specific mistake was checking the river, not the turn — one delayed barrel on the river would have been enough to win this pot',
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'The "one and done" leak is c-betting without a plan for later streets. Before betting the flop, you should already know: "If called, will I barrel the turn? With what hands? What rivers am I betting?" Without this plan, you bet the flop reflexively, then give up when called, turning your c-bet into a wasted chip. Strong players plan their entire line before betting the flop.',

    category: 'Solver Concepts',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'You are studying solver outputs and see that on a K♥-7♦-2♣ flop (BTN vs BB), the solver checks back 22 (pocket deuces) as the BTN 60% of the time.',
    question: 'Why would the solver check back bottom set on a dry flop?',
    options: [
      'Bottom set is too weak to bet on a board where villain can have top pair or overpairs that might check-raise and put you in a tough spot',
      'The solver is wrong — you should always bet sets for value because slow-playing risks giving free cards that let villain catch up or outdraw you',
      'On dry boards with few draws, slow-playing captures more value — checking protects your checking range and lets villain bluff or catch up',
      'Checking is always wrong with a set because you lose too much value from hands that would have called a bet but now get a free card',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'On dry boards (K-7-2), there are few draws to protect against. Bottom set (22) benefits from slow-playing because: (1) villain has very few draws that might get away, (2) checking protects your checking range (giving you strong hands when you check back), (3) villain may bet the turn with hands they would have folded to a flop bet. This is a key solver insight — not all strong hands should bet on all textures.',
