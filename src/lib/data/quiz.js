    scenario: 'You are on the Button in a 6-max cash game, everyone folds to you.',
    question: 'What is the correct GTO open-raise sizing from the Button?',
    options: ['2x BB', '2.5x BB', '3x BB', '4x BB'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'In 6-max, the Button opens to 2.5x BB. Early position (UTG) uses 3x; late position (CO, BTN) uses 2.5x to account for better position and wider range.',
  },

    scenario: 'UTG opens in a 6-max game. You are on the Button with J♠T♠.',
    question: 'What is the correct GTO action with JTs on the Button facing a UTG open?',
    options: ['Fold', '3-Bet only', 'Call only', '3-Bet or call (mixed strategy)'],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: 'JTs is a strong hand with great playability. In GTO, BTN uses JTs as a mix of 3-bet and call vs UTG — 3-betting adds value/fold equity; calling keeps range balanced with speculative hands.',
  },

    scenario: 'You open from the Cutoff, the Button 3-bets. You hold A♦K♦.',
    question: 'What is the correct action with AKs when facing a Button 3-bet?',
    options: ['Fold', 'Call the 3-bet', '4-bet for value', '4-bet or call (mixed)'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'AKs is a premium value 4-bet. It is too strong to fold and often too strong to flat call — 4-betting extracts value and denies equity. GTO recommends 4-betting AKs at high frequency vs BTN 3-bet.',

    scenario: 'You are in the Small Blind in a 6-max game, all players fold to you.',
    question: 'The SB RFI range is roughly what percentage of hands vs the BB?',
    options: ['15–20%', '25–30%', '35–40%', '50–55%'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'The SB opens wide (~38%) vs the BB because it is heads-up and the BB already has 1 BB invested. The SB range is the widest RFI range in the game.',

    options: ['Fold', 'Call (cold call)', 'Squeeze 3-bet', 'Depends entirely on stack depth'],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: '98s loses value vs two opponents in a multiway pot. Cold-calling is generally -EV here (dead money + OOP vs CO). Squeezing needs more equity to barrel. GTO predominantly folds 98s in this multi-opponent squeeze spot.',
  },

    scenario: 'You have been 3-bet from the BB after opening UTG in a 6-max game. You hold Q♣Q♦.',
    question: 'What is the correct GTO action with QQ vs a BB 3-bet when you opened UTG?',
    options: ['Always fold', 'Always call', 'Always 4-bet', '4-bet at high frequency, rarely call'],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: 'QQ vs a BB 3-bet is a clear 4-bet at high frequency. The BB 3-bet range is wide (bluff-heavy), so QQ has strong equity. Occasionally calling keeps range balanced. Folding is always wrong here.',

    scenario: 'You are in the Big Blind, the BTN opens to 2.5x, SB folds.',
    question: 'The BB defense range in 6-max vs a BTN open is approximately what width?',
    options: ['20–25% of hands', '30–35% of hands', '40–45% of hands', '50–55% of hands'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'The BB defends ~40–45% vs the BTN open — the widest defense range in the game. The BB already has 1 BB invested, gets a great price (call 1.5 more into ~4 pot), and BTN has the widest opening range.',

    scenario: 'You open UTG in a 7-handed game (UTG+1 position exists). Stack depth is 40 BB.',
    question: 'How should stack depth at 40 BB affect your preflop sizing?',
    options: [
      'Use larger sizes since stacks are deep',
      'Use standard sizes regardless of depth',
      'Reduce open size to 2x since stacks are shallow',
      'Shove all-in preflop with premium hands',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'At 40 BB, pot commitment thresholds change. Opening smaller (2x) is correct — your SPR with standard 3x opens becomes very low, making fold equity with 3-bets/4-bets unreliable. Smaller opens preserve stack-to-pot flexibility.',

      'Bet small (25–33% pot) at high frequency with entire range',
      'Bet medium (50% pot) with top pair or better only',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'On dry ace-high boards the PFR has strong range advantage (lots of Ax in UTG range). GTO bets small and frequently — a small bet pressures all villain hands and doesn\'t require a polar distribution.',

      'Only top pair (QQ) and better',
      'Strong hands and flush draws / combo draws',
      'Only complete air (bluffs with no equity)',
      'All hands equally — remain balanced',
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'On a wet board with a blank turn, continue barreling with strong made hands AND combo draws/flush draws that have equity. Pure air bluffs without equity (outs) are much less effective — you need a reason to continue.',
  },

    id: 11,
    category: 'Postflop',

    scenario: 'You are OOP (BB) and checked the flop. Villain bets 50% pot. You hold middle pair.',
    question: 'What is the generally correct play with a medium-strength hand facing a c-bet OOP?',
    options: [
      'Always fold — middle pair has poor equity vs a bet',
      'Always raise — show strength and take the pot',
      'Check-call and reevaluate the turn',
      'Raise to 3x to define villain\'s hand',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'Medium-strength hands (middle pair) are classic check-call hands OOP. You have pot odds, showdown value, and don\'t want to bloat the pot. Check-raise turns this into a bluff-catcher or value hand depending on run-out.',
  },

    scenario: 'BTN vs BB, you checked, villain bet 33% pot on K♦-8♣-3♥. You hold A♣-5♣.',
    question: 'With ace-high no pair on a dry board OOP, what is the GTO response to a small c-bet?',
    options: [
      'Fold — no showdown value, no draws',
      'Call — backdoor equity + potential float',
      'Check-raise as a bluff to fold out better hands',
      'Donk lead the turn if called',
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'A♣5♣ has backdoor flush, backdoor straight potential, and ace-high has some showdown value vs underpairs/air. Floating a small c-bet on dry boards OOP is a viable GTO play — you can pick up the pot on favorable turns.',
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    category: 'Postflop',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    scenario: 'You are the PFR and it is the river. Board is K♥-Q♦-7♣-2♠-J♦.',
    question: 'On the river with a polarized range, what bet size is most appropriate?',
    options: [
      '25–33% pot — small to get calls from weak hands',
      '50% pot — balanced size for all hands',
      '75–100% pot — large to polarize between value and bluffs',
      'Check — protect your range by not betting',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'The river is where polarization is maximized. With a polarized range (strong hands + bluffs), use large sizes (75–100%+ pot). This forces villain to face a difficult decision and maximizes EV from both your value hands and bluffs.',
  },
  {
    id: 14,

    difficulty: 'hard',
    scenario: 'You bet 75% pot on the river as a bluff. Villain is facing your bet.',

    options: ['33% of the time', '43% of the time', '50% of the time', '57% of the time'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'MDF = pot / (pot + bet). At 75% pot: pot = 1, bet = 0.75, MDF = 1 / 1.75 ≈ 57%. Wait — villain must CALL at 57% to prevent profitable bluffing, meaning they can fold 43%. Villain\'s correct call frequency = 1 - MDF fold = ~57% call.',

  {
    id: 15,
    category: 'Postflop',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'You have the nut flush draw on the flop. Villain bets pot into you.',
    question: 'With a nut flush draw (9 outs) facing a pot-size bet, what is the correct action?',
    options: [
      'Fold — not enough equity to continue',
      'Call — you have the right pot odds with ~36% equity',
      'Raise — your equity + fold equity justifies a raise',
      'Call or raise depending on stack depth',
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: 'NFD has ~36% equity (two cards to come). Pot odds for a call vs pot-bet = 33% needed equity, so calling is profitable. But raising adds fold equity. The correct play (call vs raise) depends on SPR and stack depth. Both can be correct.',
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    category: 'Postflop',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'You c-bet on a monotone (all same suit) flop and villain called. Turn pairs the board.',
    question: 'On a paired turn after a monotone flop, what adjustment is correct?',
    options: [
      'Always fire again — board pairing helps the aggressor',
      'Always check — the turn paired board slows everything down',
      'Check with most hands; bet only strong made hands and top flush draws',
      'Use an overbet to maximize fold equity',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'After a monotone flop, a paired turn helps the caller\'s range (they have full houses now) and reduces villain\'s drawing hands. GTO slows down with most hands, barreling only with flush+FH draws or made hands strong enough to continue.',

    scenario: 'You opened preflop, got called, and see a flop. Pot is 6 BB, effective stacks are 94 BB.',
    question: 'What is the Stack-to-Pot Ratio (SPR) in this situation?',
    options: ['~6', '~9', '~16', '~94'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'SPR = effective stack ÷ pot. 94 BB ÷ 6 BB ≈ 15.7, roughly 16. High SPR means you should be very careful about committing — you need a very strong hand to stack off.',
  },
  {

    scenario: 'Pot is $100. Villain bets $50 (50% pot). You must decide to call.',
    question: 'What is the minimum equity you need to call this bet profitably?',
    options: ['25%', '33%', '40%', '50%'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Equity needed = bet / (pot + bet + bet) = 50 / (100 + 50 + 50) = 50/200 = 25%. Wait — correct formula: equity = call / (pot after call) = 50 / (100 + 50 + 50) = 33%. You need 33% equity to call a 50% pot bet.',

    options: ['33%', '50%', '67%', '75%'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'MDF = pot / (pot + bet) = 100 / (100 + 100) = 50%. You must defend (call or raise) at least 50% of your range vs a pot-size bet to prevent villain from profitably bluffing with any two cards.',

    id: 20,
    category: 'Sizing',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'SPR at the flop is 2. You hold top pair top kicker (TPTK).',
    question: 'With an SPR of 2, how should you approach commitment decisions?',
    options: [
      'Be cautious — low SPR means villain could have you dominated',
      'Stack off immediately — low SPR makes folding -EV',
      'TPTK is strong enough to stack off at low SPR',
      'Check and pot control — protect against suckouts',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'At SPR < 4, TPTK and better are generally strong enough to commit. Low SPR means you can\'t make enough "pot-sized mistakes" by folding — the math favors getting it in with strong one-pair hands.',

    category: 'Sizing',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    scenario: 'You are the PFR with an uncapped range. Villain\'s range is capped (no strong hands). River pot is $100.',
    question: 'When you have nut advantage and villain\'s range is capped, what sizing is most profitable?',

      '33% pot — small size to keep villain in with weaker hands',
      '66% pot — balanced medium size',
      '100% pot — full pot bet',
      'Overbet (150%+ pot) to maximize value vs capped range',
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: 'Overbets are optimal when you have nut advantage and villain is range-capped. Villain cannot have the nuts so cannot raise you off your hand. Your strong hands extract maximum value; your bluffs are also more profitable because villain must call more to defend.',
  },

    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'At 100 BB, 5-bet shoving is profitable with AA, KK (value) and AKs (thin value). Bluff 5-bets with suited broadway blockers. QQ is often a call vs a 4-bet (too strong to fold, too risky to shove into a polar 4-bet range).',
