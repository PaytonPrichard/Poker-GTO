    category: 'Preflop',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    scenario: 'You are on the Button in a 6-max cash game, everyone folds to you.',
    question: 'What is the correct GTO open-raise sizing from the Button?',
    options: ['2x BB', '2.5x BB', '3x BB', '4x BB'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'In 6-max, the Button opens to 2.5x BB. Early position (UTG) uses 3x; late position (CO, BTN) uses 2.5x to account for better position and wider range.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    category: 'Preflop',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'UTG opens in a 6-max game. You are on the Button with J♠T♠.',
    question: 'What is the correct GTO action with JTs on the Button facing a UTG open?',
    options: ['Fold', '3-Bet only', 'Call only', '3-Bet or call (mixed strategy)'],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: 'JTs is a strong hand with great playability. In GTO, BTN uses JTs as a mix of 3-bet and call vs UTG — 3-betting adds value/fold equity; calling keeps range balanced with speculative hands.',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    category: 'Preflop',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'You open from the Cutoff, the Button 3-bets. You hold A♦K♦.',
    question: 'What is the correct action with AKs when facing a Button 3-bet?',
    options: ['Fold', 'Call the 3-bet', '4-bet for value', '4-bet or call (mixed)'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'AKs is a premium value 4-bet. It is too strong to fold and often too strong to flat call — 4-betting extracts value and denies equity. GTO recommends 4-betting AKs at high frequency vs BTN 3-bet.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    category: 'Preflop',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    scenario: 'You are in the Small Blind in a 6-max game, all players fold to you.',
    question: 'The SB RFI range is roughly what percentage of hands vs the BB?',
    options: ['15–20%', '25–30%', '35–40%', '50–55%'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'The SB opens wide (~38%) vs the BB because it is heads-up and the BB already has 1 BB invested. The SB range is the widest RFI range in the game.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    category: 'Preflop',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    scenario: 'UTG opens, CO calls, you are on the BTN with 9♣8♣.',
    question: 'What is the correct GTO action with 98s in a squeeze spot (2 opponents in the pot)?',
    options: ['Fold', 'Call (cold call)', 'Squeeze 3-bet', 'Depends entirely on stack depth'],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: '98s loses value vs two opponents in a multiway pot. Cold-calling is generally -EV here (dead money + OOP vs CO). Squeezing needs more equity to barrel. GTO predominantly folds 98s in this multi-opponent squeeze spot.',
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    category: 'Preflop',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'You have been 3-bet from the BB after opening UTG in a 6-max game. You hold Q♣Q♦.',
    question: 'What is the correct GTO action with QQ vs a BB 3-bet when you opened UTG?',
    options: ['Always fold', 'Always call', 'Always 4-bet', '4-bet at high frequency, rarely call'],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: 'QQ vs a BB 3-bet is a clear 4-bet at high frequency. The BB 3-bet range is wide (bluff-heavy), so QQ has strong equity. Occasionally calling keeps range balanced. Folding is always wrong here.',
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    category: 'Preflop',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    scenario: 'You are in the Big Blind, the BTN opens to 2.5x, SB folds.',
    question: 'The BB defense range in 6-max vs a BTN open is approximately what width?',
    options: ['20–25% of hands', '30–35% of hands', '40–45% of hands', '50–55% of hands'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'The BB defends ~40–45% vs the BTN open — the widest defense range in the game. The BB already has 1 BB invested, gets a great price (call 1.5 more into ~4 pot), and BTN has the widest opening range.',
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    category: 'Preflop',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    scenario: 'You open UTG in a 7-handed game (UTG+1 position exists). Stack depth is 40 BB.',
    question: 'How should stack depth at 40 BB affect your preflop sizing?',
    options: [
      'Use larger sizes since stacks are deep',
      'Use standard sizes regardless of depth',
      'Reduce open size to 2x since stacks are shallow',
      'Shove all-in preflop with premium hands',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'At 40 BB, pot commitment thresholds change. Opening smaller (2x) is correct — your SPR with standard 3x opens becomes very low, making fold equity with 3-bets/4-bets unreliable. Smaller opens preserve stack-to-pot flexibility.',
  },

  // ── POSTFLOP (8) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  {
    id: 9,
    category: 'Postflop',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    scenario: 'You raised UTG, the BTN called. Flop is A♠-7♦-2♣ (dry, rainbow, ace-high).',
    question: 'What is the correct c-bet strategy on this dry ace-high flop as the PFR?',
    options: [
      'Check — avoid bloating pot with weak hands',
      'Bet large (75%+ pot) to protect your range',
      'Bet small (25–33% pot) at high frequency with entire range',
      'Bet medium (50% pot) with top pair or better only',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'On dry ace-high boards the PFR has strong range advantage (lots of Ax in UTG range). GTO bets small and frequently — a small bet pressures all villain hands and doesn\'t require a polar distribution.',
  },

    scenario: 'You c-bet 33% pot on a Q♥-J♥-9♦ flop and got called. The turn is the 2♣.',
    question: 'Which hand type should you barrel the turn with on this blank turn card?',
    options: [
      'Only top pair (QQ) and better',
      'Strong hands and flush draws / combo draws',
      'Only complete air (bluffs with no equity)',
      'All hands equally — remain balanced',
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'On a wet board with a blank turn, continue barreling with strong made hands AND combo draws/flush draws that have equity. Pure air bluffs without equity (outs) are much less effective — you need a reason to continue.',
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    category: 'Postflop',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'You are OOP (BB) and checked the flop. Villain bets 50% pot. You hold middle pair.',
    question: 'What is the generally correct play with a medium-strength hand facing a c-bet OOP?',
    options: [
      'Always fold — middle pair has poor equity vs a bet',
      'Always raise — show strength and take the pot',
      'Check-call and reevaluate the turn',
      'Raise to 3x to define villain\'s hand',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'Medium-strength hands (middle pair) are classic check-call hands OOP. You have pot odds, showdown value, and don\'t want to bloat the pot. Check-raise turns this into a bluff-catcher or value hand depending on run-out.',
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    category: 'Postflop',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    scenario: 'BTN vs BB, you checked, villain bet 33% pot on K♦-8♣-3♥. You hold A♣-5♣.',
    question: 'With ace-high no pair on a dry board OOP, what is the GTO response to a small c-bet?',
    options: [
      'Fold — no showdown value, no draws',
      'Call — backdoor equity + potential float',
      'Check-raise as a bluff to fold out better hands',
      'Donk lead the turn if called',
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'A♣5♣ has backdoor flush, backdoor straight potential, and ace-high has some showdown value vs underpairs/air. Floating a small c-bet on dry boards OOP is a viable GTO play — you can pick up the pot on favorable turns.',
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    category: 'Postflop',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    scenario: 'You are the PFR and it is the river. Board is K♥-Q♦-7♣-2♠-J♦.',
    question: 'On the river with a polarized range, what bet size is most appropriate?',
    options: [
      '25–33% pot — small to get calls from weak hands',
      '50% pot — balanced size for all hands',
      '75–100% pot — large to polarize between value and bluffs',
      'Check — protect your range by not betting',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'The river is where polarization is maximized. With a polarized range (strong hands + bluffs), use large sizes (75–100%+ pot). This forces villain to face a difficult decision and maximizes EV from both your value hands and bluffs.',
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    category: 'Postflop',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    scenario: 'You bet 75% pot on the river as a bluff. Villain is facing your bet.',
    question: 'At what frequency must villain call to prevent you from profiting with any two cards?',
    options: ['33% of the time', '43% of the time', '50% of the time', '57% of the time'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'MDF = pot / (pot + bet). At 75% pot: pot = 1, bet = 0.75, MDF = 1 / 1.75 ≈ 57%. Wait — villain must CALL at 57% to prevent profitable bluffing, meaning they can fold 43%. Villain\'s correct call frequency = 1 - MDF fold = ~57% call.',
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    category: 'Postflop',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'You have the nut flush draw on the flop. Villain bets pot into you.',
    question: 'With a nut flush draw (9 outs) facing a pot-size bet, what is the correct action?',
    options: [
      'Fold — not enough equity to continue',
      'Call — you have the right pot odds with ~36% equity',
      'Raise — your equity + fold equity justifies a raise',
      'Call or raise depending on stack depth',
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: 'NFD has ~36% equity (two cards to come). Pot odds for a call vs pot-bet = 33% needed equity, so calling is profitable. But raising adds fold equity. The correct play (call vs raise) depends on SPR and stack depth. Both can be correct.',
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    category: 'Postflop',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'You c-bet on a monotone (all same suit) flop and villain called. Turn pairs the board.',
    question: 'On a paired turn after a monotone flop, what adjustment is correct?',
    options: [
      'Always fire again — board pairing helps the aggressor',
      'Always check — the turn paired board slows everything down',
      'Check with most hands; bet only strong made hands and top flush draws',
      'Use an overbet to maximize fold equity',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'After a monotone flop, a paired turn helps the caller\'s range (they have full houses now) and reduces villain\'s drawing hands. GTO slows down with most hands, barreling only with flush+FH draws or made hands strong enough to continue.',
  },

  // ── SIZING (6) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  {
    id: 17,
    category: 'Sizing',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    scenario: 'You opened preflop, got called, and see a flop. Pot is 6 BB, effective stacks are 94 BB.',
    question: 'What is the Stack-to-Pot Ratio (SPR) in this situation?',
    options: ['~6', '~9', '~16', '~94'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'SPR = effective stack ÷ pot. 94 BB ÷ 6 BB ≈ 15.7, roughly 16. High SPR means you should be very careful about committing — you need a very strong hand to stack off.',
  },
  {
    id: 18,
    category: 'Sizing',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'Pot is $100. Villain bets $50 (50% pot). You must decide to call.',
    question: 'What is the minimum equity you need to call this bet profitably?',
    options: ['25%', '33%', '40%', '50%'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Equity needed = bet / (pot + bet + bet) = 50 / (100 + 50 + 50) = 50/200 = 25%. Wait — correct formula: equity = call / (pot after call) = 50 / (100 + 50 + 50) = 33%. You need 33% equity to call a 50% pot bet.',

    scenario: 'Villain bets pot ($100 into $100). You are deciding whether to call.',
    question: 'What is the Minimum Defense Frequency (MDF) you must maintain vs this pot-size bet?',
    options: ['33%', '50%', '67%', '75%'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'MDF = pot / (pot + bet) = 100 / (100 + 100) = 50%. You must defend (call or raise) at least 50% of your range vs a pot-size bet to prevent villain from profitably bluffing with any two cards.',

  {
    id: 20,
    category: 'Sizing',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'SPR at the flop is 2. You hold top pair top kicker (TPTK).',
    question: 'With an SPR of 2, how should you approach commitment decisions?',
    options: [
      'Be cautious — low SPR means villain could have you dominated',
      'Stack off immediately — low SPR makes folding -EV',
      'TPTK is strong enough to stack off at low SPR',
      'Check and pot control — protect against suckouts',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'At SPR < 4, TPTK and better are generally strong enough to commit. Low SPR means you can\'t make enough "pot-sized mistakes" by folding — the math favors getting it in with strong one-pair hands.',
  },
  {
    id: 21,
    category: 'Sizing',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    scenario: 'You are the PFR with an uncapped range. Villain\'s range is capped (no strong hands). River pot is $100.',
    question: 'When you have nut advantage and villain\'s range is capped, what sizing is most profitable?',
    options: [
      '33% pot — small size to keep villain in with weaker hands',
      '66% pot — balanced medium size',
      '100% pot — full pot bet',
      'Overbet (150%+ pot) to maximize value vs capped range',
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: 'Overbets are optimal when you have nut advantage and villain is range-capped. Villain cannot have the nuts so cannot raise you off your hand. Your strong hands extract maximum value; your bluffs are also more profitable because villain must call more to defend.',
  },
  {
    id: 22,
    category: 'Sizing',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    scenario: 'You 3-bet from OOP to 12 BB (villain opened to 3x = 3 BB). Villain 4-bets to 28 BB. Effective stacks are 100 BB.',
    question: 'Facing a 4-bet at 100 BB effective stacks, when should you 5-bet shove?',
    options: [
      'Only with AA/KK',
      'With AA, KK, AKs and some bluffs',
      'Never shove — always call or fold vs a 4-bet',
      'With any pair for protection',
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'At 100 BB, 5-bet shoving is profitable with AA, KK (value) and AKs (thin value). Bluff 5-bets with suited broadway blockers. QQ is often a call vs a 4-bet (too strong to fold, too risky to shove into a polar 4-bet range).',

    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'Rule of 4: outs × 4 = 8 × 4 = 32% with two cards to come (flop to river). The actual probability is about 31.5%. Rule of 4 is accurate to within 1–2% for most draws.',

    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Rule of 2: outs × 2 = 9 × 2 = 18% on the turn with one card to come. The actual probability is ~19.6%. Rule of 2 slightly underestimates but is a useful quick calculation.',

    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'On a very wet board 3-way, GTO c-bet frequency drops sharply to ~15–25%. You need strong made hands or nut draws to bet. Bluffing is unprofitable with two opponents — one is likely to have connected with the board.',

    scenario: 'You are on the bubble of a tournament with 20 BB. A short stack with 5 BB shoves all-in from UTG.',
    question: 'How does ICM affect your calling range on the bubble vs a short stack shove?',

    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Open-limping is a fundamental error because: (1) it gives the blinds a free or cheap look with any two cards, (2) it builds no pot when you have a strong hand, (3) it shows weakness and invites raises, (4) you lose the initiative (being the preflop raiser gives c-bet opportunities).

    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Calling all three streets with marginal holdings (just top pair) when villain shows sustained aggression is a classic calling station mistake.

    explanation: 'A5s is one of the best 4-bet bluff candidates in GTO. It blocks AA (one ace removed), has suited wheel potential if called, and is not strong enough to flat call a 3-bet profitably (poor postflop playability vs a 3-bet range).

    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'On low paired boards (like 5-5-3), the PFR retains significant range advantage with overpairs and overcards. A small c-bet at high frequency is correct because: (1) villain\'s BB range has mostly missed, (2) the small size doesn\'t risk much, (3) even overcards like AK have good equity.

    explanation: 'This is a combo draw. The flush draw gives 9 outs (remaining hearts). The straight draw gives 8 outs (four 7s and four Qs). However, the 7♥ and Q♥ are counted in both categories, so you subtract 2 to avoid double-counting: 9 + 8 - 2 = 15 outs.

    explanation: '77 vs AKo is approximately 53% for the pair — a very close spot often called a "coin flip" or "race."

    explanation: 'Geometric sizing means choosing a bet size as a consistent percentage of the pot across all remaining streets to end up exactly all-in on the last street. With a pot of $10 and $90 behind, betting ~75% pot on flop, turn, and river achieves this. The formula finds the size where (pot × (1 + 2×r)^n) = stacks, where r is the fraction of pot bet.

      'Check — thin value is not worth risking a check-raise',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'Thin value bets should use small sizing (25–40% pot) because: (1) you want calls from weaker hands that fold to bigger bets, (2) you lose less when villain has you beat, and (3) the small size makes villain less likely to raise as a bluff.

    explanation: 'In a 4-way pot, your c-bet frequency should drop dramatically to roughly 20–25%. With three opponents, the probability that at least one has connected with the board is very high.

      'You should always fold in the sandwich position',
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'The sandwich position is strategically challenging because you are caught between two opponents. If you call, the player behind may raise (squeezing you).

    explanation: 'The bluff-to-value ratio is determined by the bet size. At 66% pot, villain needs to call with ~60% of their range (MDF). To make villain indifferent, your bluffs should be: bet/(pot+bet) = 0.66/1.66 = ~40% of your betting range should be bluffs, or roughly 1 bluff for every 2 value bets.

On boards like 8-6-3 or 7-5-2, the BB\'s range actually has more sets, two pairs, and strong pairs than the SB\'s wider raising range.
